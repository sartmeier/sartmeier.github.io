\subexperiment{Description}
The office was out of use for one day before starting the experiment. The door was open beforehand. The CleanAir device was placed in the middle of the long wall of the office but was not turned on. Distances were marked using a tape to ensure that before and after measurements are taken from the same location. Plates were placed at the indicated distances from the CleanAir device. Plates were left open for the time of incubation (48min, room temperature). The door was closed during incubation. Starting time of the incubation was 9:56 am, incubation was finished at 10:43 am. The plates were then sealed with tape.\\
The CleanAir device was turned on for 38min at maximum power. The door was closed during air cleaning. (Estimated air turn over rate?)\\
Plates were placed at the indicated distances, the ClearAir device was turned off and plates were left open. Incubation was at room temperature and started at 11:21 am and ended at 12:09 pm. Plates were sealed with tape.\\
Plates were left at room temperature until colonies are formed. (to be continued.)

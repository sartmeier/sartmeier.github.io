\subexperiment{Description}
The office was out of use for one day before starting the experiment. The door was open beforehand. The CleanAir device was placed in the middle of the long wall of the office but was not turned on. Distances were marked using a tape to ensure that before and after measurements are taken from the same location. Plates were placed at the indicated distances from the CleanAir device. Plates were left open for the time of incubation (48min, room temperature). The door was closed during incubation. Starting time of the incubation was 9:56 am, incubation was finished at 10:43 am. The plates were then sealed with tape.\\
The CleanAir device was turned on for 38min at maximum power. The door was closed during air cleaning. (Estimated air turn over rate?)\\
Plates were placed at the indicated distances, the ClearAir device was turned off and plates were left open. The door was opened only shortly and closed immediately before device was turned off and plates were setup. Incubation was at room temperature and started at 11:21 am and ended at 12:09 pm. Plates were sealed with tape.\\
Plates were left at room temperature until colonies are formed. (to be continued.)

\subexperiment{Observations}
\begin{itemize}
\item first CFUs were found at day 4 for both experimental setups
\item funghi are only found in the setup before clean air device was run
\item CFUs in the post clean air experiment are smaller and slower growing
\item possible reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item these are more resilient bacteria, perhaps spore forming bacteria
\item bacteria are weakened
\end{itemize}
\item CFUs in post clean air experiment are found predominantly in plates that were located near the doors
\begin{itemize}
\item could be brought in through door when device was turned off and plates were placed
\item bacteria were "on the way" to get to the device when air flow was stopped
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
possible shortcomings:
\begin{itemize}
\item agar plates are for dermatophytic microbes, so some microbes might not grow on this medium that might be able to colonize other human organs
\item CFUs cannot be classified
\item only qualitative outcome (quantitative results could be obtained through air samplers)
\item no direct measurement of virus possible
\end{itemize}
